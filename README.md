# Pizza Machine - Pineapple Edition

### Project Description
The Pizza Machine - Pineapple Edition is a project aimed at developing a pizza machine capable of producing delicious pizzas with pineapple toppings, catering to the preferences of pineapple pizza enthusiasts. The machine will automate the entire pizza preparation process, ensuring consistency in quality and taste.

### Key Features
1. **Automated Dough Preparation:** Implement a system for automatically preparing pizza dough, ensuring consistent quality.
2. **Sauce Dispensing Mechanism:** Develop a mechanism for evenly spreading tomato sauce on the pizza base.
3. **Cheese Application System:** Design a mechanism for applying an even layer of cheese on the pizza to achieve the desired texture.
4. **Pineapple Topping Dispenser:** Create a specialized dispenser for accurately distributing pineapple toppings across the pizza.
5. **Customization Options:** Incorporate user-friendly interfaces to allow customers to customize their pineapple pizzas, such as adjusting the quantity of pineapple or choosing additional toppings.
6. **Automated Cooking Process:** Implement an automated cooking process to ensure pizzas are cooked to perfection, taking into account the pineapple toppings.

### Development Stages
1. **Requirements and Planning:** Define project requirements, goals, and milestones. Develop a detailed project plan, including timelines and resource allocation.
2. **Mechanical Design and Prototyping:** Design the mechanical components of the pizza machine and create prototypes for testing and refinement.
3. **Automation Software Development:** Develop the software for automating the pizza preparation and cooking processes. Implement customization options and user interfaces.
4. **Quality Control Mechanisms:** Integrate quality control features to monitor and ensure the quality of pizzas. Implement error handling and reporting mechanisms.
5. **User Interface Development:** Design and develop user interfaces for customers to interact with the pizza machine, prioritizing a positive user experience.
6. **Integration with Ordering System:** Integrate the pizza machine with an ordering system for streamlined order processing. Test the end-to-end order placement and pizza production workflow.
7. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Conduct comprehensive testing of all components and features. Address any issues identified during testing.
